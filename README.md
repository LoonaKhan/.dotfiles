# .dotfiles
Various config, .*rc and lists of packages in my current setup.

## included files/folders:
- .bashrc
- .pythonrc
- .noderc?
- .rubyrc?
- .vimrc
- .vim/
- pacman_packages
- snap_packages
- flatpak_packages
- .themes/
- .fonts/
- .icons/
- wallpaper
- arch_install_script.sh

## todo:
- add node and ruby rc's
- fix up the vim stuff
- keep track of all packages. shouldnt be too hard; just a command to list all packages and echo to a file
- move the aesthetics stuff to the aesthetics folder
- re-write the arch script
- make a script that auto-does all this for me. and commits it here too???
- cant add .vim/ directory because the plugins all have .git/ directories. will see if these are necessary
